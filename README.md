# Flutter Quiz Application

This application was designed following the YouTube tutorial shown at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBBl1tYkUnE, created by Bram Vanbilsen.
This application will allow a user to tap on a landing page to begin the quiz, will be shown a set of true/false questions, and be given an overall score at the end of the quiz. Material design and UI components were used throughout this project.
